# portfolio-fm-368

A website I designed and coded myself to display all the certification projects I made for the responsive web design certificate in freecodecamp.org.

## Token System
I like to think my token system would work in a professional environment except for my colors honestly, I'm aware --cyan-dark isn't exactly professional and I would spend more time on the naming conventions for future projects.

## Design Decisions
One intentional decision was swapping images using Javascript rather than just CSS alone. Using Javascript gave me direct control over the image sources rather than working with CSS and over complicating things.

The dark mode color choice was also deliberate, rather than just desaturating the colors down to black and white, I played with other values to keep a teensy bit of color to feel more intentional rather than feeling like a filter was applied over the colors.
